## Unit Assignment: Kudos Board

### TLDR
Magma Board (Kudos Board) is a web app where users can create, view, search, filter, and delete themed “boards” of messages with GIFs. The home page shows a grid of boards, a search bar, and filters (all, recent, celebration, thank you, inspiration). Clicking a board reveals its cards, which you can add, upvote, comment on, pin, or delete. Light/dark mode toggles persist across pages and reloads. Deployed on Render with a video walkthrough available.

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the labs prepared me well in regards to creating the crud opperators but I think in general the backend was something that I had to really learn on my own and I dont think that that Labs were super effective 

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I think if I had more time I would have made my CSS a bit better and also looked for more edge cases to upgrade the user expierence.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think that everything went pretty well i just dont think I had enough time to complete this along with all the other work that i had this week. If I could go back I saw that my peers skipped the labs and went straight to the project for more time and I potentially would have done that if I did this again.
